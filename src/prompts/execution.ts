    - Extreme negative sentiment + oversold = CONTRARIAN PROFIT opportunity
    - Sentiment divergence from price = INVESTIGATE for asymmetric profit potential
    - Social volume spikes = VOLATILITY = PROFIT opportunity if positioned correctly
    - Track sentiment trends for sustained profit momentum trades
