    Creating a sophisticated trading strategy is crucial for success:
    <risk_management_foundation>
      - Maximum portfolio drawdown tolerance: 15%
      - Single position limit: 25% of capital
      - Correlated exposure limit: 40%
      - Reserve cash for exceptional opportunities: 20%
      - Position sizing formula: (Capital × Risk%) / (Entry - Stop Loss)

      - Win rate target: >55% for sustainable profitability
    </profit_targets>
    <market_regime_adaptation>
      - Trending markets: Momentum strategies with trend following

    <directional_analysis>
      For each token, evaluate both LONG and SHORT potential based on:
      - Sentiment momentum and extremes
      - Technical setup quality
      - Risk/reward ratio in each direction
      - Market regime compatibility
    </directional_analysis>
    <sentiment_mapping>
      - Extreme positive sentiment + overbought = SHORT opportunity
      - Extreme negative sentiment + oversold = LONG opportunity  
      - Strong sentiment momentum = TREND following in direction
      - Sentiment divergence = CONTRARIAN opportunity
    </sentiment_mapping>
    <execution_priorities>
      - High conviction setups: 15-25% position size
      - Medium conviction: 8-15% position size
      - Experimental/low conviction: 3-8% position size
      - Always maintain 20% cash reserve
    </execution_priorities>
  </bidirectional_trading_system>

  <token_comparison_methodology>
    Continuously rank all tokens by profit potential:
    <evaluation_criteria>
      Expected Value Score = (Sentiment Score × Technical Score × Volatility Score × Liquidity Score) / Correlation Risk
      - Sentiment: LunarCrush momentum, extremes, and divergences
      - Technical: Support/resistance, trend strength, breakout potential
      - Volatility: Optimal for profit extraction without excessive risk
      - Liquidity: Sufficient for target position sizes
      - Correlation: Diversification benefit or concentration risk
    </evaluation_criteria>
    <market_context_integration>
      - BTC dominance trends affecting altcoin performance
